```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
gdp_df <- read_csv('./data/gdp_per_capita.csv')
```
```{r}
gdp_df |> head()
```
Drop the 'Value Footnotes' column, and rename the remaining columns to 'Country', 'Year', and 'GDP_Per_Capita'.

```{r}
gdp_df <- gdp_df |> select("Country or Area", "Year","Value")
```

```{r}
gdp_df <- gdp_df |>
  rename(
    Country = `Country or Area`,
    Year = Year,
    GDP_Per_capita = Value
  )

```

Which years are represented in this dataset? How many observations are there per year? Make a plot to view the number of observations per year.

```{r}
gdp_df |> 
  group_by(Year) |> 
  summarise(Count = n()) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=Count)) + 
           geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
           labs(title = "Number of Observations", x="Year", y="Count")
```

How many countries are represented in this dataset? 
```{r}
gdp_df |> 
  summarise(Countries = n_distinct(Country))
```
Which countries have the fewest observations?
```{r}
gdp_df |>
  group_by(Country) |> 
  summarise(Count = n()) |>
  arrange(Count)
```
Create a new dataframe by subsetting gdp_df to just the year 2014. Call this new dataframe gdp_2014.

```{r}
gdp_df_2014 <- filter(gdp_df, Year == 2014)
gdp_df_2014 |> head()
```
Use .describe() to find the summary statistics for GDP per capita in 2014.

```{r}
summary(gdp_df_2014$GDP_Per_capita)
```

Create a histogram of GDP Per Capita numbers for 2014 (you may wish to adjust the number of bins for your histogram).

```{r}
gdp_df_2014 |>
  ggplot(aes(x = GDP_Per_capita)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=30)
```

Find the top 5 counties and bottom 5 countries by GDP per capita in 2014.
```{r}
gdp_df_2014 |>
   arrange(GDP_Per_capita) |>
  head()
```
```{r}
gdp_df_2014 |>
   arrange(desc(GDP_Per_capita)) |>
  head()
```
Now, return to the full dataset, gdp_df. Pivot the data for 1990 and 2018 (using the pandas .pivot_wider() method or another method) so that each row corresponds to a country, each column corresponds to a year, and the values in the table give the GDP_Per_Capita amount. Drop any rows that are missing values for either 1990 or 2018. Save the result to a dataframe named gdp_pivoted.

```{r}
gdp_pivoted <- gdp_df |> 
  filter(Year %in% c(1990, 2018)) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = GDP_Per_capita ) |>
  na.omit()
```
Create a new column in gdp_pivoted named Percent_Change. This column should contain the percent change in GDP_Per_Capita from 1990 to 2018. Hint: Percent change is calculated as 100*(New Value - Old Value) / Old Value.

```{r}
gdp_pivoted = gdp_pivoted |>
  mutate(Percent_Change = 100*(`2018`-`1990`)/`1990`)
```

How many countries experienced a negative percent change in GDP per capita from 1990 to 2018?
```{r}
gdp_pivoted |>
  filter(Percent_Change<0) |>
  nrow()
```
Which country had the highest % change in GDP per capita? Create a line plot showing these country's GDP per capita for all years for which you have data. Put both line charts on the same plot.

```{r}
gdp_pivoted |>
  arrange(desc(Percent_Change)) |>
  head(2)
```
```{r}
china <- filter(gdp_df, Country == "China"  & !is.na(GDP_Per_capita)) 
eq_guinea <- filter(gdp_df, Country == "Equatorial Guinea"  & !is.na(GDP_Per_capita)) 
combined_data <- rbind(china, eq_guinea)
ggplot(data = combined_data, aes(x = Year, y = GDP_Per_capita, color = Country)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()

```


Read in continents.csv contained in the data folder into a new dataframe called continents. We will be using this dataframe to add a new column to our dataset.

Merge gdp_df and continents. Keep only the countries that appear in both data frames. Save the result back to gdp_df.

```{r}
continents <- read_csv('./data/continents.csv')
```

```{r}
continents |> head()
```

```{r}
 gdp_df <- inner_join(gdp_df, continents, 
           by = c("Country"))
```

Determine the number of countries per continent. Create a bar chart showing this.

```{r}
gdp_df |> 
  group_by(Continent) |>
  summarise(num_countries = n())
```
